 * No `settleSeconds`, and that is now a checked claim rather than an omission: this engine's
 * `createInitialState()` IS its resting state.

 * `controls.test.tsx` measures the opening window — the simulated time the chart shows — against
 * the band the module goes on to occupy, and fails if anything it opens on is a value it does not
 * hold. So a settle that was never calibrated can no longer hide as a settle that is not needed.
